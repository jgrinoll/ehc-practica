            <p>The Classic Burger is a quintessential American dish, combining the best of simplicity and flavor. At its
                core is a juicy 100% beef patty, perfectly cooked and topped with sharp cheddar cheese. Fresh lettuce,
                sliced tomato, and tangy pickles add crunch and brightness, while the sesame seed bun holds it all
                together, giving the burger its satisfying texture. Condiments of ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise bring
                just the right amount of sweetness and creaminess to complete the flavor profile.</p>

            <p>This burger is all about tradition, offering a delicious, no-frills experience that’s both comforting and
                satisfying. Whether you’re craving a quick meal or looking for a classic, the Classic Burger delivers on
                every front with its familiar ingredients and timeless appeal.
